/**
 This is a dead-simple example designed to let you make sure you have valid credentials, a venue, and can build with the SDK.
 
 All you need to do is modify the Info.plist file to include your MappedInUsername and MappedInPassword, both of which should have been provided by MappedIn. Then hit run, and after it loads you should see a map displayed on screen.
