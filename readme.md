## Mappedin SDK for iOS v6 Samples

To read more about the Mappedin SDK for iOS, refer to [Getting Started with Mappedin SDK for iOS](https://developer.mappedin.com/ios-sdk/getting-started) and additional guides in the Mappedin developer docs.

The sample projects in this repo provide a key and secret to access demo maps. Production apps will need their own key and secret. Refer to [Create a Key & Secret](https://developer.mappedin.com/ios-sdk/getting-started#create-a-key--secret) for instructions on how to create your own.

The following table lists the sample activities that pertain to the latest version of the Mappedin SDK for iOS.
