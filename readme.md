# Mappedin iOS Samples

This repo contains sample applications demonstrating different ways to integrate with the Mappedin SDK for iOS to render maps and build a custom indoor mapping experience. To learn more about ways to integrate with Mappedin, refer to [developer.mappedin.com](https://developer.mappedin.com/).

The Mappedin SDK for iOS enables you to build powerful and highly flexible indoor mapping experiences natively on iOS.

This repo also contains a project demonstrating how to use an iOS WKWebView to integrate with our out of the box web product, [Mappedin Web](https://www.mappedin.com/wayfinding/web-app/).

## Mappedin iOS SDK Examples

To read more about the Mappedin SDK for iOS, refer to [Getting Started with Mappedin SDK for iOS](https://developer.mappedin.com/ios-sdk/getting-started) and additional guides in the Mappedin developer docs.

The sample projects in this repo provide a client Id and client secret to access demo venues. Production apps will need their own unique client ID and client secret. Contact your Mappedin representative in order to obtain identifiers for your venues.

The following table list the sample applications that pertain to the latest version of the Mappedin SDK for iOS. PlaygroundSamples lists the activity name after the sample name.
