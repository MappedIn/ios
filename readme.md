# MappedIn iOS Examples

You can view all the up to date documentation in this project's [GitHub Page](http://mappedin.github.io/ios/).

We've provided a key and secret in this repo that has access to some demo venues.

When you're ready to start using your own venues with the SDK you will need to contact a Mappedin representative to get your own unique key and secret.

## Walkthrough

This is simple walkthrough to get you started with the MappedIn iOS SDK, with minimal code, and lots of helpful comments. The Mappedin iOS SDK provides many ways to interact with the MapView and map data, but as this sample demonstrates, there is no built-in UI or default map interactions. You have complete flexibility over the behaviour, look and feel of applications built using the SDK.

Use this sample to start off if you want to integrate with the Mappedin iOS SDK from scratch. Take a look at the next sample in this repo for sample code on how to use a few of the key features the SDK provides.

## Wayfinding Demo

This is a fully featured sample app. It is integrated with Apple's location service. We've provided keys with access to a few venues including a fake mall called "Mappedin Demo Mall." We've also included a GPX file called Location.gpx that simulates a user moving around this venue.

If you want to try out the blue dot functionality, you will need to **Edit Scheme**, **Allow Location Simulation**, and select this **Location** as **Default Location**. Right now it is set up to simulate user walking around mappedin-demo-mall. Modify the coordinates in this file if you wish to simulate a different location


## Mappedin WebView Example

This is a short demonstration of creating a Web View in an iOS application, and displaying Mappedin Web. It also contains an example of setting up external links to open in a separate browser.

To get you started we've provided a Mappedin Web API key and secret that has access to some demo venues.

When you're ready to start using your own venues you will need to contact a Mappedin representative to get your own unique key and secret. Add your Mappedin API keys, search keys, and the venue's slug to this file.
